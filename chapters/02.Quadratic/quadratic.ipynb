Studying the minimization of quadratic systems can teach us about the minimization of general convex functions. Quadratic systems are also crucial in their own right!

    "1. Write the minimization problem in the standard form.\n",
    "2. Use the function `generate_noisy_measurements` to generate $m=100$ noisy measurements (standard deviation is 1, default) of a vector with dimensionality $n=1000$. Use the functions `make_connection_matrix` and `make_bookkeeping` to generate the associated matrices $K^{-1}$ and $R$.\n",
    "3. Use $C=1$, generate $\\mathbf{x}^\\star$ using the closed-form solution, using gradient descent and gradient descent with momentum. How many steps do the two descent methods need to converge? Use a vector of zeros as the initial point.\n",
    "4. Minimize the system for values of $C=1\\times 10^{-2}, 1\\times 10^{-1}, 1, 10, 100$.  Use for momentum $\\beta=0, 0.1, 0.2,\\ldots, 0.9$. Make a table of the number of steps needed to reach convergence for the different values of $C$ and $\\beta$. Make a plot with the different $\\mathbf{x^\\star}$ for different values of $C$. Note that the result should be (nearly) the same whether you use momentum or not, only the number of steps will differ."
